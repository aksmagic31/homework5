# This is a  Work Day Scheduler
The user can use this work day scheduler to save To-Dos during business hours ( 9 AM to 5PM )

## How it works
The work day scheduler will list the date and hours within the date

The calendar will change color based on past current or future of the hour. any of the past hours will be in gray, the present will be in coral and the future will be in green.

user can submit the To-Do list and it will store to the localStorage and list in the schedules at the end of the page.

## Problems.
Have trouble showing it after reload
